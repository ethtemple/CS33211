# Banker's Algorithm

The project is to implement the Banker's algorithm to determine if the system is in a safe state.

## Features

- **Compute the Need Matrix**: Calculates the resources needed for each process to complete.
- **Check for Safe State and Display Safe Sequence**: Simulates allocation of resources and displays safe sequence if it exists.

## Files

- `banker.cpp`: Algorithm Implementation

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
g++ banker.cpp
